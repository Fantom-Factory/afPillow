For 1.0.0
=========

Option to turn off auto routing (for fantex)

Update welcome page to index.html -> index.*

add welcome page / redirect strategy -> see EfanXtraConfigIds 

redirects are important - there should only be the ONE url for any given page. multiple page for the same context

afIoc::IocErr (when index page has init params)
- Route `//*` must only contain a path. e.g. `/foo/bar`

For Future
==========

Add service for adding client uri finders / matchers

Add optional extension to routes, e.g. .html

Maybe cache uri, contentType, etc in a PageMeta service, so we only calculate this stuff the once
