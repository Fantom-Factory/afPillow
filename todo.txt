=========

Pillow header in dev

Update welcome page to index.html -> index.*, e.g. capture extensions

redirects are important - there should only be the ONE url for any given page. multiple page for the same context

afIoc::IocErr (when index page has init params)
- Route `//*` must only contain a path. e.g. `/foo/bar`
seems like the ServerGlob is being generated wrongly
- put all welcome pages at the end of the routes

For Future
==========

Add optional extension to routes, e.g. .html

Maybe cache uri, contentType, etc in a PageMetaSrc service, so we only calculate this stuff the once
