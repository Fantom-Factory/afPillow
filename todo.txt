
Create a first class EventMeta object that can be injected, returned, and rendered

List PillowConfigIds strings in pod.fandoc and NoDoc PillowConfigIds - copy / paste rules!

Pillow - respond to HEAD requests



Bad Ideas
=========

@PageEvent should default to POST not GET (for security) ... but:
 - It is NOT expected behaviour
 - All HTML forms default to GET
 - It's a massive breaking change


Pillow - pageContext is Str (when composed from URL) and object when made from .withCtx([...])
 - So? Args get coerced to their real types via ValueEncoders
